## Understanding the Project Structure

Before making changes, familiarize yourself with the project's structure. If possible, consult with project maintainers or community members through forums or chat channels to gain insights.

## How to Submit a Pull Request

Here are the steps to submit a pull request effectively:

1. **Development**: Make your changes within your new branch.
2. **Testing**: Before submitting, test your changes thoroughly to ensure functionality and avoid breaking existing features.
3. **Committing Changes**: Commit your changes with a detailed message, describing what you have done.
4. **Pushing Changes**: Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.
5. **Creating a Pull Request**: Go to the SourcProject repository and create a new Pull Request. In your PR description, mention the changes made, any relevant issue numbers, and tag maintainers or other stakeholders for review.
6. **Code Review**: Once submitted, the maintainers will review your PR. Be ready to incorporate feedback or make necessary changes.

## Reporting Bugs

To report a bug:

1. **Identifying Bugs**: If you find a bug, check the issues tab first to see if it has already been reported.
2. **Detailed Report**: Create a new issue with a detailed description of the bug, steps to reproduce, and expected behavior. Including screenshots or videos can be very helpful.
3. **Labeling**: Label the issue appropriately as a 'Bug'.

## Proposing Enhancements

When proposing enhancements:

1. **Research**: Ensure the enhancement hasn't already been suggested by checking the issues tab.
2. **Creating an Issue**: Create a new issue describing the enhancement, its benefits, and how it aligns with the project's goals.
3. **Discussion**: Engage with the community and maintainers to discuss the enhancement further.
