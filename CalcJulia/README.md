## CalcJulia
Meet CalcJulia â€“ built entirely using the Julia language. If you've used the Mac calculator, you'll find some familiar touches here. 
It's simple, straightforward, and leverages Julia's robust libraries.

This is my first solo project, a step into the world of coding. I hope you find it useful, 
and who knows? There might be updates down the road to add more features.

Thanks for checking it out. Feedback is always welcome :D!
